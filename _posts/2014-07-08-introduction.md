title: San Francisco and the Bay Area
---

So I've been in the San Francisco and Bay Area for a little over a month now, and I continue to be filled with excitement. There are so many things to do and see; whether it be tech-related (yeah, I'm a geek), or nature-related (I love the outdoors).

I'd like to share with you some of the things I've accomplished off of my bucket list, and some that I still have to do!

### Buckets filled

* Grabbing some tasty, tasty In-N-Out
* Going to the Alameda County Fair
* Flying
* Visiting Yosemite
* Mountain Biking in Pleasanton Ridge
* Chilling in Santa Cruz at the beach
* Exploring San Francisco
* Spending a night watching the Oakland A's at the coliseum

### Buckets still empty

* Participate in a hackathon (they fill up so fast!)
* Attend a San Francisco Giants game (soon!)
* Check out the Pacific Coast Highway (planned)
* Visit Monterey and Hearst Castle (also planned)

I personally think I've done a decent job checking things off, and I've been having a blast doing it. In fact, I'm not so sure I've included everything on these lists because I've done (and wish to do) so much!

If you haven't yet had the chance to visit the Bay Area, you ought to very soon.
